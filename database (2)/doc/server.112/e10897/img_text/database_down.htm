<body>
<p>This image shows a portion of the Database Home page. At the upper right corner of the page is the date and time at which the last page refresh occurred and a Refresh button. Below that button are two buttons: Startup and Perform Recovery. To the left of those buttons, even with the left margin, is a Database Instance section, which shows a red down-facing arrow, and, next to a Status heading, the status of Down. This section also displays the name of the host, the port, the SID, and the Oracle Home for the database instance. To the right of this section is a Details field which states "There has been a user-initiated shutdown."</p>
