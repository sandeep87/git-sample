KNOWN ISSUES

- Saving iCal data to a device using the sample provided may not be supported on some devices. Testing on target devices is recommended. See accompanying online documentation for full overview of all classes and JavaScript functions.

- The line-height property is not supported in Opera Mini. As a result, the height of certain elements will not render as expected.

- The slide show component is not recommended for Series 40 WebKit browsers because it is not compatible with certain early builds of the browser on touch devices.

COMPATIBILITY

Includes S60 5th Edition and Symbian^3 devices such as the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic, Nokia N97 Mini, Nokia C7-00, and Nokia N8 devices. 

Note: These templates are also compatible with many other WebKit touch-enabled browsers such as those found on iPhone and Android devices. 

2. Nokia WebKit (nontouch)
WebKit nontouch versions >= 525, including many newer S60 3rd Edition, Feature Pack 2 devices such as the Nokia E72 and Nokia E5-00 devices. Also supported are older S60 3rd Edition devices using WebKit version 413, such as the Nokia N95, Nokia N82, Nokia N79, Nokia N96, and Nokia 6720 Classic devices.


3. Series 40 WebKit
Includes newer Series 40 6th Edition touch and nontouch devices such as the Nokia X3-02, Nokia 6303 Classic, and Nokia 6260 Slide devices, which use a Series 40 optimised WebKit browser. 

4. Maemo
Includes the Nokia N900 device. The templates should also be compatible with the Firefox Mobile browser.

Note: The templates are suitable for use with Opera Mini 5 for smartphones. However, the line-height property is not supported in Opera Mini. As a result, the height of certain elements will not render as expected.
