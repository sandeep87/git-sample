<!--  GalleryView, by default will highlight the entire cell, which is great for a single image,
 but, we've would like a custom highlighting that just select the image, and not the whole cell.

 To make that happen, we must first turn off the selector for GalleryView, that's what this file
 does.  Then we need to create a similar selector (selectable.java) that highlights for just the
 image portion of the cell.
