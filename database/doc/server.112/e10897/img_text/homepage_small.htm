<p>This is a partial screenshot of the Database Home page. The page heading is "Database Instance," followed by the instance name, which in this case is "orcl.example.com". Beneath the heading, a row of links goes horizontally across the page. Each is the title of a separate Enterprise Manager subpage, where each subpage contains different administrative functions. The page titles are Home (highlighted because the Home page is the current page), Performance, Availability, Server, Schema, Data Movement, and Software and Support. Beneath the property page links are the various sections of the home page. Each section has various combinations of links, controls, and text or graphical elements that display database status. Sections on the Database Home page include General (for instance and listener information), Host CPU, Active Sessions, Diagnostic Summary, Space Summary, High Availability, Alerts, and more.</p>
