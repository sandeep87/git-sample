<p>This image is an illustration of the typical workflow for investigating, reporting, and resolving a problem. The workflow tasks (1â€“6) are described in the text following this image. Each task is represented by an oval. In each oval is a task number, task name, and an icon that indicates the activity for the task. (For example, for Task 6, the Close Incidents task, there is an image of a door closing.) The task ovals are arranged in a circle with arrows pointing from one task to another.</p>
