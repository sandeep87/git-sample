<p>This is a screenshot of the Add Table Object Privileges page. At the top of the page is an empty list named Select Table Objects. This list has a flashlight icon to its right. Below this list, on the left-hand side of the page is a scrolling list of available privileges. To the right of that list is a scrolling list of selected privileges, which is empty. Between the two scrolling lists are the following buttons: Move (with an icon showing a right arrow), Move All (with an icon showing a double right arrow), Remove (with an icon showing a left arrow), and Remove All (with an icon showing a double left arrow). At the far right of the page are OK and Cancel buttons.</p>
