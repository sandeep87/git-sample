        // CONFIRMATION
        "Confirmation patterns are necessary, especially if the user might "

        + "this can happen with use of the back button. The set action for "
        + "the back button is “cancel and discard” all changes. This may "
        + "cause difficulties, especially for people who are new to the "
        + "platform. To ensure that they do not discard previously made "
        + "changes, it is necessary to have a query following the back "
        + "command. The query must have at least 2 choices: YES/NO. In "
        + "addition, it is possible to add a help option to the query. "
        + "Please also check the other dialog layouts that are possible. "
        + "\n\nOn the other hand, there is no need for an additional "
        + "confirmation query if the user accepts changes that were made "
        + "in a form, via the tick mark in action button #1."
        + "\n\nFor more information on confirmation patterns, please see "
        + "the Series 40 full touch style guide.",
        
        // NO CONTENT
        "It is important to indicate to people if there is no content. "
        + "This will prevent people from perceiving your application as "
        + "broken or unresponsive. It may also help the out-of-box "

        + "content or a very obvious explanation of how to add their first "
        + "content."
        + "\n\nThis mini app shows 3 different variations:"
        + "\n\n- an indication of ‘no content’ but no further action"
        + "\n\n- an add button in the content area, which disappears "
        + "after the first content is added"
        + "\n\n- an add button as action button #1, and a textual hint "
        + "informing the user that they should use this button to create "
        + "their first content"
        + "\n\nFor more information on empty content, please see the "
        + "Series 40 full touch style guide.",
        
        // MULTIPLE ITEMS
        "The multiple items patterns show how to handle the selection of multiple "
        + "items in case there is:" 
        + "\n\n- a positive selection, like adding multiple images to an e-mail,"
        + "\n\n- a negative selection, like deleting multiple items permanently from the "
        + "phone."

        + "\n\nIn a positive selection, the indicator for selecting an item is a white "
        + "checkmark on top of a green squircle. Action button 1 is filled with a "
        + "checkmark. The checkmark is greyed out in case no selection has been made. "
        + "Pressing the active checkmark in action button 1 does not evoke any "
        + "additional confirmation query, since the selection does not cause any "
        + "final loss. The user can undo the step easily, just by removing the "
        + "files from the list of attached files."

        + "\n\nThe negative selection, in contrast, could display a designated icon in "
        + "action button 1 showing the action being performed – for example a trash "
        + "bin icon in case of deleting the items. The item marker could be a white "
        + "cross on a red squircle. This clearly indicates that this item will be "
        + "deleted when the action button 1 is tapped. Both metaphors imply a negative "
        + "connotation. When deleting an item permanently, the application should show "
        + "a confirmation query after action button 1 is pressed. This prevents the "
        + "user from losing important items just because of a badly performed gesture. "
        + "Action button 1 is dimmed as long as there is no selection made, i.e. "
        + "no item is marked."
        + "\nHowever, both patterns require a confirmation query in case the user "
        + "presses back. The query is always positively formulated, i.e. do you want "
        + "to perform this action? NO – YES – BACK.",

        
        // ZOOMING
        "Zooming can be done in various ways. This mini app demonstrates "
        + "three common ways:"
        + "\n\n- pinch zoom, for zooming in and zooming out"
        + "\n\n- slider zoom, where a separate slider component is used"
        + "\n\n- tap zoom – double tapping toggles between maximum (2) "
        + "zoom factor and normal (1) zoom factor"
        + "\n\nThe image can be panned in any of the cases."
        + "\n\nFor more information on zoom, please see the Series 40 "
        + "full touch style guide.",
        
        // ADD NEW
        "This pattern demonstrates how to add new items to a form. The button "
        + "at the bottom of the form adds a new item. It is not possible to dim "
        + "an item and make it become active later. The entire form is saved by "
        + "pressing the checkmark in action button 1, or via back button and "
        + "the related confirmation query. The query is always positively "
        + "formulated, i.e. do you want to perform this action? NO – YES – BACK.",
        
        // INTERDEPENDENT
        "This pattern shows how to overcome the fact that it is not "
        + "possible to dim items. The example demonstrates three "
        + "interdependent popup choicegroups. The selection of the "
        + "choicegroup defines the content of the next choicegroup. "
        + "Popup choicegroup is well suited for this task, since it "
        + "does not change too much of the visible content in case there "
        + "is a change in a previous item. Besides, the closed choicegroup "
        + "allows the user to glance the entire selection."
        + "The Done button is only shown in case the user has made a "
        + "selection from the last popup choicegroup. The StringItem "
        + "button is more visible than the icon in action button one (in "
        + "case the StringItem is always shown above the fold) and might "
        + "ease the selection task. "

        + "\n\nA real-life task could be the selection of town:"

        + "\n- Country"
        + "\n- (Optional state)"
        + "\n- Town"
