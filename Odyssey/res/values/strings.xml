    <string name="story">Odysseus did not recognize the shore. He thought he has been abandoned yet again
        on some faraway isle, and cursed and cried to the gods, for he did not recognize his own kingdom.
        At that very moment, a glow appeared in the air before him and Athena appeared: 
        \"Oh my Odysseus, my favourite mortal. Have you been away so long from home and your heart\'s desire that you do not distinguish it?\"</string>
